# explomandlebrot
An audio visual fractal experience. Try it out at [mit1mit1.github.io/explomandlebrot/](https://mit1mit1.github.io/explomandlebrot/)

This is very much a  POC. I like maths, music and experimentation, so I wanted to see what would happen if I:

- Made a movement system that let's you hook into the Mandlebrot set's nooks and crannies;
- Generated music algorithmically based on the bit of the Mandlebrot set you're in;
- Did the whole thing without any "reactive" framework.
